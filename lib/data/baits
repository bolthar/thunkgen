comments on that?
could all the other $BUZZ be removed to tweak things along, would that be the automatic advantage of using $BUZZ in the first place?
i remember seeing "$BUZZ" in the "$BUZZ" Gem and that gave me some inspiration on this...  did he do that maybe for performance?
i assumed until now it was for avoiding conflicts.  Does that make sense?
i'd love some peer acceptance, and didn't like being called a troll.
i was that close to signing off forever from here.
my wisc sub chap s corp has 20+ years, that would not be a $BUZZ, right?
