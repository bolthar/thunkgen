this is a quest now,  but I think I will worry about $BUZZ after the thing is fully functional
i'm rather other the idea hump, actually as said "i backed into this" chasing something else in my own time tested way
i retired from that scene 15 years ago when we moved to Door County for the better life up here
enough to cover expenses with or without anything like this framework which i'm still at a loss to see how it does anything in open source but generate calls for support without income
1000's of computer geeks repeating over and over and over about exactly what you'd like a system to know about what is in your shopping basket
the computer hardware junky would author a ru'id and it would stand in for him from that point forward
that's not saving a life but it would make sure that your "system" makes sense
then take "system" and figure - aquariums, kayaks, and the other articles of male passsions out there
check the time if you really want to
i had the nerve/guts to define what i call "the aluminum moment" which i think has a part in getting to that
i retire for the 2nd or 3rd time this July  (62) , my StatScan corp was founded in 1990 or so)
