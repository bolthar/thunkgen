this thing has gone from peaking at 2500 ($BUZZ) / sec down to 1800 or so
i even put in some "$BUZZ" logic to cut down on redundancy
my suspicion is that the dynamic $BUZZ around creating $BUZZ must be slow compared to just cloning $BUZZ
i probably could have used one of those dynamic $BUZZ instead of a "$BUZZ" 
...but the $BUZZ and all are just so simple/elegant in this thing. 
I have all kinds of methods to $BUZZ/trace now
my generalize and filled with Ruby Goodness "WhiteBoard" designed has dropped performance
if this 'framework about nothing'  system can be judged to be "framework worthy" (another seinfield) by some trusted 3rd party then a path could likely be worked out
having resources for optimizing some of this WhiteBoard stuff would probably tweak the performance and a demo site would make it really nice
i was really doing more interesting things in domain#2 but those are out of data now
this one is way simple and part of the "start up phase" for domain #3
since I haven't finished that yet i don't have any better ones in this domain yet
they are the result of a "Expert Session"
